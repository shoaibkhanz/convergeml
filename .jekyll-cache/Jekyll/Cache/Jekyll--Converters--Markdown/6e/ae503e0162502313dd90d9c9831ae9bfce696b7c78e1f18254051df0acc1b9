<p>I am extremely passionate about applying data science and this is where I try to breakdown concepts around <span style="color:#ea9808; font-weight: bold">machine learning</span>, write about them critically and develop a better understanding.</p>

<p>I also believe that in the real world, its important to not only have the technical expertise but also rigour of problem solving. Itâ€™s essential to see the world from various <span style="color:#ea9808; font-weight: bold">perspectives</span>, never be afraid to ask a question and always be ready to learn. I am excited about learning new stuff and ready to apply them to find solutions to <span style="color:#ea9808; font-weight: bold">problems (new and old)</span>, improving as I go along.</p>
