<p>My name is <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">Shoaib Khan</code></strong> and this is where I try to breakdown concepts around <code class="highlighter-rouge">machine learning</code>, write about them critically and develop a better understanding. In the real world, its important to not only have the technical expertise but also rigour of problem solving. Itâ€™s essential to see the world from various perspectives, never be afraid to ask a question <code class="highlighter-rouge">(job is easy this way)</code> and always be ready to learn.</p>
