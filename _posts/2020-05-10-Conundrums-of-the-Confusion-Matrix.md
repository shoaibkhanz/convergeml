Its extremely important to understand your model's performance. In this post, I explain fundamental metrics such as <span style="color:#ea9808;">precision, recall, accuracy, error rate</span> etc.. these metrics help us evaluate all types of classification models e.g. <b STYLE="color: #868686">logistic regression, random forest, neural network</b> etc.
I had written this <A STYLE="color: #ea9808" HREF="https://medium.com/convergeml/conundrums-of-the-confusion-matrix-2fa82293707a">post</A> originally on Medium and its been appreciated by many for its simplicity and visuals.
