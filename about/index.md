{% epigraph ' "All models are wrong, some are useful" ' 'George Box' 'Journal of the American Statistical Association' %}

I am the author behind **convergeml** with a simple goal of explaining the concepts of <span style="color:#ea9808; font-weight: bold">machine learning</span> with brevity. While its important to understand the mechanics and deep-rooted meaning of algorithms, it is equally vital to understand the use case and not be blinded in sheer excitement. I am passionate and keen to grasp the ideas of machine learning and its <span style="color:#ea9808; font-weight: bold">applications</span> in the real world and I hope so are you !

I hope that you find the writings useful and share your feedback.
